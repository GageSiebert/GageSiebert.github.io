		<h4>Moon</h4>
      <img src="images/Moon_2019.05.13.png" alt="Moon1.png" width="640" height="480">
      <p>Taken on May 13, 2019 in central Wisconsin. Only a few seconds of integration time.</p>
      <hr>
      <h4>Saturn</h4>
      <img src="images/Saturn_2019.05.13.png" alt="Saturn1.png">
      <p>Taken on May 13, 2019 in central Wisconsin, with about 1 minute of integration time.</p>
      <img src="images/2020-05-31_Titan.png" alt="Titan1.png">
      <p>Taken on May 31, 2020. The image was altered to make Saturn's largest moon, Titan, (the dot in the bottom left) more apparent.</p>
      <hr>
      <h4>Jupiter</h4>
      <img src="images/Jove_5.13.19.png" alt="Jupiter1.png">
      <p>Taken on May 13, 2019 in central Wisconsin, with about 1 minute of integration time. The orange speck off to the left is Jupiter's volcanic moon, Io.</p>
      <hr>
      <h4>M57, Ring Nebula</h4>
      <img src="images\RingNebula.PNG">
      <p>Taken on October 15, 2019 in central Wisconsin. This is a single short exposure frame. The noise is really high because my camera's gain is just about maxed out. I haven't managed to stack these images yet; I can't get any software to effectively track such low SNR images. I may write a code to do it by hand someday, but that would take a while. Also, I have an alt. az. mount that isn't motorized, which means I need to get my camera pointed on M57 by hand. This is obviously possible, but it's not easy. My equipment is not meant to handle deep sky objects, but it's a good challenge.</p>
      <hr>
      <h4>ISS</h4>
      <img src="images\ISS_5_31_2020.png">
      <p>Unfortunately the image is a bit over exposed. At the time of this image, the first manned SpaceX dragon capsule, carrying Douglas Hurley and Robert Behnken, was about 45 seconds behind the ISS as seen from the ground.</p>

      <h4>My Setup</h4>
		<p>8-inch dobsonian and ASI120MM planetary camera. I've seen it said that 8-inch isn't big enough to see much of the Messier catalog, but I suspect it is if your conditions are dark enough. So far, I'm at 34 Messier Objects. Also unless otherwise stated, all images were taken in central Wisconsin.</p>
