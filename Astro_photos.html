      <h4>M57, Ring Nebula</h4>
      <img src="images\RingNebula.PNG">
      <p>Taken on October 15, 2019 in central Wisconsin. This is a single short exposure frame. The noise is really high because my camera's gain is just about maxed out. I haven't managed to stack these images yet; I can't get any software to effectively track such low SNR images. I may write a code to do it by hand someday, but that would take a while. Also, I have an alt. az. mount that isn't motorized, which means I need to get my camera pointed on M57 by hand. This is obviously possible, but it's not easy. My equipment is not meant to handle deep sky objects, but it's a good challenge.</p>

      <h4>My Setup</h4>
		<p>8-inch dobsonian and ASI120MM planetary camera. I've seen it said that 8-inch isn't big enough to see much of the Messier catalog, but I suspect it is if your conditions are dark enough. So far, I'm at 34 Messier Objects.</p>
