      <h1> The Heat Equation </h1>
      <p> Here a special case of the 1D heat equation is considered. \(u_t(x,t)=u_{xx}(x,t)\), with boundary conditions \(u(0,t)=0\) and \(u(\pi,t)=0\), and with initial condition \(u(x,0)=f(x)\). The nuance will be in what we choose \(f(x)\) to be. </p>
      <hr>
		<p> The solution will be of the form:</p>
      <p style="text-align:center;">\( u(x,t)=\Sigma_{n=1}^\infty a_n \sin (nx) e^{-n^2t} \)</p>
      <p> Where \(a_n\) are the fourier coefficients of \(f(x)\).</p>
     
      <p>Of coarse the \(n=1\) mode becomes dominant at large \(t\), but what about before that? For most \(f(x)\) it's easy to imagine that \u(x,t)\) would just 'melt' until it becomes indistinguishable from the \(n=1\) mode. However consider the case where for the first few terms, the value of each \(a_n\) is much greater than the last. Each term decays much faster than the last as well, and one can imagine choosing the magnitudes of the \(a_n\)'s such that there is a period of time where each is dominant.  This was done with the first four \(a_n\) to yield the following:</p>

      <p>The temperature varies over more than 20 orders of magnitude so maybe this isn't an observable phenomenon. The experimental setup I was imagining was a wire held in a vacuum and \(f(x)\) was imposed by lasers, but I suspect there is no material that is solid over this range of temperature. Also, I'm neglecting heat capacity's temperature dependence which would change things.</p>
      <hr>
      <p> The axis are distracting so lets get rid of them. Also this model can demonstrate extreme sensitivity on initial conditions. Neglecting \(a_2\) and \(a_3\) only changes \(f(x)\) by about one part in a thousand, but it has a dramatic outcome on the systems trajectory.</p>
